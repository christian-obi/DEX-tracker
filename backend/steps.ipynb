    "Here’s your step-by-step roadmap for building the DEX tracker:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plan & Gather Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Define exactly which DEX data you’ll track (volume, liquidity, timeframe).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Confirm CoinGecko API endpoints for DEX data (e.g., /exchanges/{id}, /exchanges or /coins/markets).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Choose time intervals (e.g., daily, hourly).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Backend Development (FastAPI + Pandas)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Set up FastAPI project in a Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Install dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, pandas, requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Write a service to:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Call CoinGecko API for DEX volume & liquidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Process and clean data with Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Aggregate time-series data for chart rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Return JSON endpoints for the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Add caching (optional) to reduce API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Frontend Development (v0 + React + Chart.js)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use Vercel’s v0 to scaffold a React app.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create pages/components for:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Dashboard — displays total volume & liquidity KPIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Charts — interactive line/bar charts using Chart.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Fetch data from your FastAPI backend endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Add date range pickers and DEX selection filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Connect Backend & Frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Ensure CORS is enabled in FastAPI for your frontend domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Test API calls from the React app.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Display live, formatted numbers (with thousand separators, currency symbols).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Deploy\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Deploy FastAPI backend:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Option A: Deploy on Vercel serverless (with Python API routes).\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Option B: Deploy separately (e.g., Railway, Render, or AWS Lambda) and point frontend to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Deploy frontend to Vercel with v0 build.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Set environment variables (API base URL, CoinGecko API keys if needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Final Touches\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Add loading states and error handling in the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Optimize chart rendering for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Include mobile-friendly responsive design.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Add a footer with API attribution to CoinGecko (required by their terms)."
